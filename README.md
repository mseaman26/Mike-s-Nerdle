# Mike-s-Nerdle
Welcome to Mike's Nerdle! It's a remake of the famous Nerdle game.  I chose to make this because I knew it would involve some fun coding challenges and I wasn't wrong! If you're not familiar with the rules to the Nerdle game, just visit:
[https://nerdlegame.com](https://nerdlegame.com) and read over the rules.<br><br>
I made this app with React and a couple other libraries including mathjs and dayjs.  The equation updates automatically at midnight.  Feel free to play daily! You can find Mike's Nerdle at:<br><br>
